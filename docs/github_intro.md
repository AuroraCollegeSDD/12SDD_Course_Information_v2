# Getting to know GitHub

## What is it?
Github is a 'hub' for 'git'  :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

*Git* is a version control system which keeps track of changes and modifications to software projects as they develop. It allows different developers to work on different parts of a project and keeps track of all the changes so that when the different parts are merged together there is automatic checking for conflicts and other problems. Each project is stored in a **repository**. When a developer starts work on a new part of the project they create a **fork** or separate branch. As the developer makes changes they make **commits** to this branch with notes describing and explaining the change. When the developer is ready to integrate their work back into the main project they make a **pull request**. The other members of the project can then review and approve the proposed changed. Once the changes are approved the fork is merged back into the main project called the **master branch**.

*GitHub* is a **hub** or place where out in internet land where all of this git stuff takes place. In other words it is one of several sites where git repositories are stored. In additional the the basic git functions of version control, GitHub repositories also have project management tools and wikis and other features.

[What Is GitHub, and What Is It Used For?](https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/) provides a more detailed explanation of GitHub.

If you would like to know more about how to use GitHub effectively, and if you are serious about software development you should because it is the industry standard, then you can find video tutorials on the [GitHub Training and Guides Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7RrmoueENv9TZts3HXXtw) channel.

## How do I use it?
The typical **workflow** for a GitHub Classroom assignment is:
1. Accept the invitation for the assignment. This will create a repository or **repo** which is shared with you and the teacher for an individual task, or you, the teacher and the rest of your team for a group task.
2. Fork the master branch. All of your work should be done in the fork, not in the master branch.
3. As you make changes **commit** them to the fork. You should commit at least at the end of every session, and preferably several times a session. Make sure you provide meaningful comments on all your commits. Before you commit any changes make sure you are committing to the fork not the master. 
4. When you are ready to submit your work, or even to get your teacher to review it, create a pull request. This allows you to start a conversation with your teacher to get feedback on your work.
5. Once you and your teacher are happy with the work your teacher will perform a merge on the pull request, or approve you doing the merge.
