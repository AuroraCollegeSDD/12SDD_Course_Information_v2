# 12SDD20 Course Information
Course Information for the Aurora College 12 SDD Course in 2020

## The Big Plan
In this course we will take a project based learning approach, presenting the theory and developing skills in the context of individual and group projects.

The projects are:
- algorithms and coding
- database
- consultant scenario
- game
- new coding language
- logic game

Each of these projects will be completed in Github Classroom.

## Resources
Important resources for this course can be found in the `docs` folder of this repo. You particularly need to be come familiar with the Course Specifications document - this is your *bible*, you must learn it chapter and verse and be able to recite its passages in your sleep. This folder also contains the Scope and Sequence which is an outline of the structure of the course, and the syllabus which contains all the content and outcomes to be covered in the course. You are encouraged to use the syllabus to check off the course content and outcomes as it is covered.

As we progress through the source we will also be developing a [course wiki](https://github.com/AuroraCollegeSDD/12SDD20_Course_Information/wiki) which you can use as a study guide. Please bookmark [this link](https://github.com/AuroraCollegeSDD/12SDD20_Course_Information/wiki) for future information.

## Assessment
Formal assessment will consist of:
- Skills task (based on skills developed in the algorithms and coding project)
- Theory assignment (based on skills developed in the database and consultant scenario projects)
- Major project (this will be the game developed in python)
- Trial exam (based on skills developed in all projects).
